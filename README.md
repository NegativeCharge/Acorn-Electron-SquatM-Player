# Acorn Electron SquatM 1-bit Beeper Engine Player

- SquatM beeper music engine
- Originally written by Shiru 06'17 for ZX Spectrum 48K
- Ported to Atari 8-bit by Shiru 07'21
- Ported to the Acorn Electron by Negative Charge 11'22

The track currently needs to be included at the bottom of main.6502 (samples are in the tracks directory)

SquatM tracks can be composed in 1Tracker (https://shiru.untergrund.net/software.shtml) - you will need to export the track in Atari ca65 format, and manually convert to BeebAsm format (see samples for changes required).

The call to turn the speaker on/off is quite wasteful at the moment and still needs optimizing.

Release Notes:

- v0.1 - Initial ca65 port
- v0.2 - Fully converted to BeebAsm. Debug rasters now off by default as they waste cycles.
- v0.3 - Removed need for turbo board by reducing internal loop count from 64 to 32.
